This is Work in Progress fighting game involving my characters. Thank you for playing my game

Known bugs:
-Training mode save states will reset the save state characters and stages

Notes:
Animation - 
MarkV is a tester character that was used to test the engine mechanics, especially with how it works with sprites. As such *All* of its animations are sprites from other games. Muramasa on the other hand has "sketches" and while a few of her sprites (mainly defensive and hitstun mechanics) are sprites similar to MarkV those are being replaced as soon as possible. Almost all animations are "placeholder"/Cardboard but while some are sketches others are from other games to test the engine.

Moves - 
Moves/Damage/Properties/etc. are subject to change given the extremely early nature of this game.
