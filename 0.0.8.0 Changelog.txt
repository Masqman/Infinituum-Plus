	-These extra spins have bonus damage and do not scale like the normal hits
-Changed Love Dart hitbox to not crossup nearly as much
-214C changed directory.
	-doesn't combo off of a raw hit without OTG, instead leading to a very good tech chase. The window is much tighter.
	

Toy Changes:
	-Toy command "AB" and "CD" no longer result in invulnerability post throw
	-Changed H Exhaltation(s.214B) to cause Tumbling, changed trajectory, reduced KD time
		-Removed 12f of recovery on a successul throw

Danse Macabre changes:
	Danse Macabre Parry:
		-Increased Hitstop for both characters, on a successful Parry
		-Parry window increased to 20
		-Dance Parry now has "hyper armor" behavior
	-Dance now builds Danse Macabre Aura Levels over time. Also, builds 1 Danse Macabre Aura Level on a successful Parry.
	
Danse Macabre Aura:
	-Levelling Behavior changed. Each level lasts for a shorter time than the previous level, each levels effect increase more heavily than the last.
	-Death Aura steals meter, if there is no meter it steals health
		-Muramasa's current issue is the constant need for meter. The current behavior adds more damage output which she doesn't need, making it useless. Therefore reducing the potential damage output a bit and giving her a soft tool to mitigate this gives it more use and makes it something worthwhile to use in match.
